# Flynux
The linux so lightweight that it can fly

## Overview
This linux distro is based off Ubuntu LTS, but stripped down: almost every unneeded component has been removed in favour of flyness (lightness) and usability
on older machines.

## Download and installation
We offer 2 editions of Flynux:
1. Flynux Live CD with installer: normal Flynux medium, uses GNOME and can be installed easly
2. Flynux Live CD: Flynux medium based off Ubuntu Server, uses xfce and cannot be installed easly. It has limited driver and program support. Reccommended for offline tasks and emergency booting.

Then, you can:
- Burn the downloaded ISO to a DVD
- Write the ISO to an USB (we personally reccommend Ventoy)
- Attach the downloaded ISO to a Virtual Machine (VMware is optimal)

The installation is like a normal Ubuntu installer, but we reccommend:
1. Select install
2. When you reach the installation type select the normal installation and clear the 2 checkboxes
3. Every setting in other sections should be fine

## Building
For building those custom ISOs we used Cubic. So you need:
1. 30 GB of free space (50 GB best)
2. Ubuntu Desktop (I built this with 22.04 host)
3. A lot of Ubuntu knowledge
4. A LOT OF TIME AND PATIENCE

We left in this repository the cubic config files, so you just need to import them to cubic and start building the ISO.
